Portfolio Overview: Domeneak Addison
My portfolio website showcases my work as a Full Stack Software Developer & Designer. It features an interactive interface with a futuristic tech-inspired design, highlighting four key projects:

G&K Construction LLC (2024-2025): My first professional website - a responsive construction company site with interactive customer reviews, star ratings, custom slideshow functionality, and an admin dashboard. Built with vanilla JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and custom CSS.
C++ Grocery Store System (2024): A console-based application that simulates an online grocery store where users can add items to a cart, update prices, apply discounts, and calculate bills with tips. Demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, and memory management.
C# Election Vote Counter (2024): A console application that streamlines vote tallying by collecting candidate names and vote counts, calculating percentages, and determining winners. Features clean separation between business logic and user interface using C# and .NET Framework.
Zoo Management System (2023): An object-oriented C++ application simulating a zoo where users can add different animals and make them speak. Showcases advanced OOP concepts including inheritance, polymorphism, abstract classes, smart pointers, and custom exception handling.

The portfolio itself is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dynamic animations and interactive elements that respond to user actions. The design incorporates glowing energy lines and expanding information cards to create an engaging user experience.
